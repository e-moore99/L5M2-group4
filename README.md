## Mission 02 - Turners Car Insurance Project

The code here is for two APIs. 
API 1 calculates a premium cost for your vehicle based on the model and year, API 2 decides your insurance risk rating based on user input about incident history.

This project was completed using test driven development practices and the use of Jest. We created test cases for the end product before creating the API itself.
